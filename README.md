# PortfolioWebsite

A portfolio website that was design and made using HTML5, CSS3(Sass), and JavaScript. I also included the THREE.js library to use particles.

# Motivation

The reason why this website was made was because I have made a portfolio website before using React.js and Bootstrap. I did not like it that much and decided to make another one. I used canva to come up with the design. The design was inspired by looking at other portfolio websites that I have seen.
